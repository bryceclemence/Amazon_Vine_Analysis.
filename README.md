# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help us get a better understanding of big data using Amazon Web Services tools. In this challenge we analyzed Amazon reviews 
written by members of the paid Amazon Vine Program to see if paid reviewers had any bias to them. I personally chose to do my analysis on the video game reviews, using 
Google Colaboratory.


### Results
The results are as followed;

There were 94 Vine reviws

### Summary
After my analysis there does seem to be some bias in the video game reviews for members who are apart of the paid Amazon Vine program. As you can see above, 5 star reviews from members who were not Vine members are at 38.70% and 5 stars reviews from member who were paid as part of the Amazon Vine Program had a percentage of 51.06%, definitely hinting at the fact that if you pay people, they are going to leave better reviews, overall hurting the actual ranking of the video game. An additional analysis we can do is comparing the reviews from Amazon to the reviews left on Gamestop, or BestBuy, to see how people reviewed the game on those platforms and how it compared to the reviews left on Amazon
